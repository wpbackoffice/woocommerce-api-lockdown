Protect your data by restricting what is available through your WooCommerce REST API on a site wide or per user basis.

== Description ==

While WooCommerce's REST Api (v2.1+) allows easy integration with your favorite 3rd party services, it also opens the doors for users to access all of your store details including: 

* Order Details
* Customer Details
* Product Information
* Coupon Codes
* Store Reports

WooCommerce API Lockdown allows you to restrict what is available through your API on a site wide or per user basis with an easy to use admin panel.

Usage

1. Once installed, in your WordPress backend navigate to to 'WooCommerce' -> 'API Lockdown'
2. Select any site wide restrictions 
3. Select any users specific restrictions
4. Click update that that's it.

What Happens when a Restricted User Tries to Gain Access
If a user tries to access a section they don't have access to they will simply get a Authentication Error.
